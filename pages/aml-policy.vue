    <h2 class="Title Title--type-h2">CRIME AND DISORDER (INCORPORATING FRAUD AND AML)</h2>
    <h4 class="Title">Section 1 – Experience</h4>
    <p class="Text">
      The Director of Dux Group N.V. (hereinafter – «Company») has lengthy experience in securing
      gaming businesses against criminal misuse and implementing wide ranging anti-fraud and
      anti-money laundering processes, procedures and extensive staff training programs.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      Underpinning future training programs will be knowledge of the Proceeds of Crime Act and Money
      Laundering indicators usually detected in a gaming environment, particularly in a Card Not
      Present transactional environment.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      The director is fully aware of all aspects of the Proceeds of Crime Act and his
      responsibilities and is well placed to impart knowledge of Anti –Money Laundering measures and
      requirements having secured major remote and non-remote gaming businesses in this field.
    </p>

    <h4 class="Title">Section 2 – Anti Money Laundering and Transaction Fraud</h4>
    <p class="Text">
      Gaming environments are often targeted by those wishing to launder money. The speed of
      transactions and use of multiple payment processing options make gaming businesses especially
      vulnerable to this activity.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      As a result, many of the initial trading and procedural decisions of the director are either
      directly aimed at combatting this threat or protections are enhanced as a bi-product of the
      overall commercial and trading approach/strategy taken by the business.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      ALL staff will be given training in Money Laundering indicators such as (but not limited to):
    </p>
    <ul class="SupportPage-List AmlPolicyPage-List">
      <li class="SupportPage-Item AmlPolicyPage-Item">Unusual Betting Patterns</li>
      <li class="SupportPage-Item">
        Suspicious deposit and withdrawal patterns (size and frequency)
      </li>
      <li class="SupportPage-Item">Reliability of Card Data</li>
      <li class="SupportPage-Item">Customer verification issues and Identity Theft</li>
      <li class="SupportPage-Item">Account linkage/multiple accounting</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Text">
      All instances of suspected Money Laundering attempts must be reported to the MLRO but that
      suspicion must not be conveyed to the customer and further actions must await consents. The
      MLRO is then responsible for liaising with, submitting Suspicious Activity Reports and seeking
      consents from the NCA/UKFIU where and when appropriate. He will also ensure that appropriate
      registers are kept for all related reporting.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      Company will implement a FULL ‘Know Your Customer’ policy. This will assist in tackling not
      just Money Laundering threats but other fraud threats generally. Customers will be advised at
      registration and generally on the supporting non-transactional website that Company will
      utilise online verification tools and that in instances where we are not able to satisfy
      criteria, ID and address verification documents will be requested.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      Other key decisions that will enhance these protections include setting period
      thresholds/velocities for withdrawals to include at outset the requirement for checks and
      director approval prior to processing card withdrawals and bank transfers of over 3000 EUR in
      one single transaction, a maximum of 3 (three) daily withdrawals and an overall maximum daily
      withdrawal of 9000 EUR.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      Industry accepted standards that will always lead to Enhanced Due Diligence (the requirement
      for further proof of ID and Address) will be withdrawals in excess of 3000 EUR in a single
      24hour period and 9000 EUR in a 90-day period. Simple online verification will NOT be
      acceptable in these circumstances.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      The business will also not have any cash element to it, mitigating risks associated with
      counterfeit monies.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      Systems will be operating to record all transactions for an account. These account histories
      will be subject to a program of regular and continual checks against fraud and social
      responsibility indicators. Where unusual bet patterns and winning patterns are detected, these
      will also be cross- referenced to call history to ensure that staff are not colluding with
      customers or acting illicitly.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      Company will also keep a register of those customers that it identifies as high risk or
      politically exposed. Those accounts will be subject to greater scrutiny and frequency of
      checks.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      In general, where illegal or inappropriate behaviour by staff is identified, investigatory and
      disciplinary procedures will follow those outlined in staff contracts as required by
      employment law directives and the need to use in greater propensity, measures such as
      suspension when for example transactional fraud is suspected and those activities form a
      standard part of an employee’s job description.
    </p>

    <h4 class="Title">Section 3 – Security and Monitoring</h4>
    <p class="Text">
      It is essential to implement adequate monitoring procedures in any gaming business across
      premises, equipment, people, communications and transactions. Company will implement a range
      of measures and procedures to ensure security and safety in these areas.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      Company has installed Call recording technology. This has multiple benefits that include:
    </p>
    <ul class="SupportPage-List">
      <li class="SupportPage-Item">Staff Training</li>
      <li class="SupportPage-Item">
        Ensuring accuracy of bet (timing and placement) and transaction data
      </li>
      <li class="SupportPage-Item">Customer and Brand Reputation Protection</li>
      <li class="SupportPage-Item">
        Implementation of robust and frequent monitoring procedures that will guard against and
        deter collusion between staff and customers
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Text">
      The protection of data and the security of software and hardware generally are of prime
      concern for any business where transactions and data are recorded in a Non-Face to Face
      environment. Consequently, Company will implement an overarching policy of ‘Encrypt whatever
      can be Encrypted’. Access to Shared Drives will be strictly limited and monitored and where
      appropriate, password protected. Data Storage and Back-Up solutions/procedures exist to ensure
      that Customer Data is not accessible to outside parties and reliably prevents loss of data.
    </p>

    <h4 class="Title">Section 4 – Responsible Relationships with Customers and Businesses</h4>
    <p class="Text">
      Company will be publishing General Rules, Terms and Conditions on its website. These will make
      specific reference to fraudulent activity, prior knowledge of a result or the likely result of
      an event and matters relating to match fixing and suspicious events. It will detail the
      actions we may take where cheating is suspected or identified and will detail the extent to
      which we will co-operate with regulators and sports governing bodies to tackle these matters.
      This will in general allow a transparent communication process with customers in these
      instances.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      However, the director is acknowledged that in the event that serious criminal activity is
      suspected or identified, it is also incumbent on they and staff that those suspected of this
      activity are not ‘tipped off’ as to those suspicions and subsequent investigations and that in
      some instances, alternative approaches will be required. Appropriate staff training and
      escalation procedures will be in place.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      Company will take all necessary measures to ensure the propriety of its relationships with
      other businesses. This will entail a standardized due diligence approach often accompanied by
      Non-Disclosure Agreements where appropriate. This will require default disclosure of ownership
      and management structures, company incorporation details, address and contact details. Details
      of these investigations will be templated and records kept.
