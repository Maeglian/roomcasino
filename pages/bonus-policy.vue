          In the case that bonus money is wagered and lost, but not all wager requirements were met,
          the next deposit made to your account, providing you don't have any open games, will
          automatically reset the bonus as Consumed and it will not be necessary to complete the
          remaining wager requirements. If you want to continue your game session and make sure that
          your bonus gets Consumed, please contact support after your deposit. Any abuse of this in
          order to avoid completing bonus wagering will result in all winnings being removed, and
          your deposit potentially being confiscated.

          request, and the wagering was not completed, all your winnings will be removed including
          any pending/unclaimed winnings from games/promotions you played whilst you had the bonus.
