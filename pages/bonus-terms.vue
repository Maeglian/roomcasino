      number, payment system account (Neteller, Skrill, etc.), one electronic device (computer,
      mobile phone, tablet, etc.).
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      All the players can take advantage of the bonuses, except for the cases when the bonus has
      country restrictions and the player is a citizen of one of these countries. Players from
      Sweden are not allowed to receive bonuses. Any bonuses are not available to players from
      Sweden, including participation in any kind of promotional programs, receiving VIP rewards, as
      well as exchange of comp points.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      The player is not allowed to abuse the bonus offers. In case of such abuse the Casino has the
      right to prohibit the Player to receive any bonuses and to cancel any winnings received using
      bonus funds, both at the moment of wagering and after it.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      The use of bonus funds purely to progress through the bonus stages is prohibited, particularly
      in the cases when bonus or cash funds are used purely to progress through the bonus stages
      (e.g. collecting 9 out of 10 coins to reach the bonus feature), and then final stages (e.g.
      playing to collect the final coin to reach 10 out of 10 and the bonus feature) are completed
      with cash bets when bonus funds have been forfeited, lost or wagering has been met, and
      converted to cash. All the winnings gained during that play may be considered void.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      The Player is not allowed to use any strategies while playing with an active bonus in order to
      fulfil the requirements to wager the bonus. If the Player uses such strategies, and if the
      Casino has sufficient grounds to believe that the Player's actions are aimed solely to obtain
      financial benefits using the bonus advantage, then the Casino reserves the right to cancel all
      Player's winnings.
    </p>
    <p class="Text">
      All the bonuses have a minimum deposit requirement for obtaining the bonus, limitation of the
      maximum possible bonus amount, wagering terms, limitation of the maximum amount of bets while
      wagering, time limitation of bonus life, unless otherwise indicated.
